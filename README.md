Welcome to Straw Hat CLI monorepo.

## About

**The Intent** of the CLI is to fit the needs of Straw Hat organization,
therefore, the decisions are made to fit those needs.

> "Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design
> whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure."
> Melvin E. Conway.

**The objectives** are to automate and optimize the development environments,
allowing developers to focus on their tasks in hand instead of dealing with
build tools, consistent environments, and repeatable tasks.

In order to achieve such goals, we trade off customizations, and personal
preferences. But we encourage healthy discussions about how we could improve our
ecosystem and adapt to better practices, **your opinion matters**.
